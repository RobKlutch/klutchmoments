* Issue 1: Video Preview Start Point
* Expected Behavior: The Video Preview stage should start playback from the beginning of the clip defined in the Timeline stage (using the cut-timeline settings).
* Actual Behavior: The Video Preview consistently starts at the 5-second mark, ignoring the Timeline stage settings.
* Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Upload a clip.
    2. Define a custom start point in the Timeline stage.
    3. Move to Video Preview stage.
    4. Observe that playback begins at the 5-second mark instead of the Timeline start point.
* Potential Root Cause:
    * The cut-timeline metadata (start/end times) is not being passed from the Timeline stage into the Video Preview stage.
    * A default start offset (5 seconds) may be hard-coded in the preview player.
* Proposed Fix:
    * Confirm that the Timeline cut data is persisted and accessible by the Video Preview stage.
    * Remove/override any default 5-second offset logic in the preview playback handler.
* 
* Issue 2: Highlight Feature Not Attaching
* Expected Behavior: The highlight in the Video Highlight stage should remain attached to the player selected in the Timeline stage, following that player through playback.
* Actual Behavior: The highlight does not attach to the selected player. It appears the selection data is either not being passed correctly from the Timeline stage or the overlay logic is failing to align with the tracked player coordinates.
* Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Upload a clip.
    2. Select a player in the Timeline stage.
    3. Proceed to the Video Highlight stage.
    4. Observe that the highlight does not attach to the chosen player.
* Potential Root Cause:
    * Player selection data (player_id or bounding box) is not persisted or mapped into the Video Highlight stage.
    * Overlay logic may be referencing a default or empty coordinate set rather than the tracked player’s coordinates.
    * Tracking module may not be initialized with the selected player’s bounding box.
* Proposed Fix:
    * Ensure the player selection JSON/state from Timeline stage is correctly stored and retrieved in Video Highlight stage.
    * Validate the overlay function to confirm it uses tracked player coordinates, not placeholder data.
    * Add a fallback/logging step if player selection data is missing or invalid, so failures are visible in testing.
